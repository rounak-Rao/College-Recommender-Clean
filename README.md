Smart College Recommender is a personalized web application that helps students make better college decisions by balancing Return on Investment (ROI) and Quality of Life (QoL). Users input their household income, intended major, list of potential colleges, and state of residence. The app predicts student debt using a custom-trained XGBoost model, adjusts based on in-state tuition and parent loan factors, estimates earnings by major, and incorporates a QoL score powered by AI. Built with FastAPI, React, and XGBoost, this project aims to reduce regret and improve outcomes in college decision-making â€” all through data-driven insights.
